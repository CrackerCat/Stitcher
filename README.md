Stitcher
========

Stitcher is a lightweight and fast class transformation library for Java developed using the
[ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) library which is suitable for usage during runtime.

:warning: Stitcher is not yet considered stable and is still largely a pet project for my own purposes. There may exist
lurking issues which impact generated bytecode correctness. Please report any issues you find on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/stitcher/issues).

## Features
- Support for code injection, method redirection and overwriting, local variable capture, field and method shadowing
- Supports obfuscated environments with plugin re-obfuscation as a Gradle build task
- Detects early class-loading errors which prevent transforming targets
- Compiles to a single JAR for the Forge platform which weighs in just under 120KB with dependencies included

## Building

Clone the repository and use the provided Gradle wrapper to perform a build with the following command:

```
